   - Run the command `git commit -m [commit message]` to commit the changes. The commit message should briefly describe the changes you've made.

6. ### Push your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

   - After committing your changes, you need to push them to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Run the command `git push origin [branch name]` to push your local branch to your forked repository.

7. ### Open a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository.

   - Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and you should see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on it.
